## MEAL CONNECT

MealConnect is a web platform that connects restaurants with surplus food to users seeking donations. 
This application helps reduce food waste and provides an opportunity for restaurants to donate excess food to people in need
where the restaurant will connect to the food shelters for food enquiry and giving excess supply to them and then the needy people can look for the 
nearest food shelters and order the supply and then the food shelters delivery man delivers the food to those locations . 
Thus, food shelters will act as a mediator between restaurants and the end costumer.
